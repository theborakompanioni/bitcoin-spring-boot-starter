In the spirit of [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Phone Numbers](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/FALSEHOODS.md), 
here is a list of mistaken perspectives on Bitcoin.

1. **Block height will only increase.**
   
1. **Block time will only increase.**
   
1. **Once a valid transaction is in the mempool, it will end up in the blockchain.**
   
1. **Before a transaction becomes part of the blockchain it must be in the mempool.**
   
1. **Yeah, but once it is in a block, it will stay in the blockchain forever.**
   
1. **All wallets support p2pkh transactions.**
   
1. **All wallets use standardized derivation paths.**
   
1. **Brain wallets are secure.**
   
1. **There are only 21 million bitcoin to ever exist.**
   
1. **Bitcoin is anonymous.**
   
1. **Exchanges will always allow withdrawal of funds.**

1. **The bitcoin in my exchange account is mine.**

1. **The bitcoin on my exchange account actually exists.**

1. **Each transaction has exactly one receiver.**

1. **Each transaction has exactly one sender.**

1. **The destination of a Bitcoin transaction (output) is always an address.**

1. **A miner will always select the transactions with the highest fees.**

1. **All transaction hashes in the bitcoin blockchain are unique.**

1. **Fees are a specified explicitly in a transaction.**

1. **The 12 (or 15, 18, 21, 24) words of my seed phrase are everything I need to recover my wallet.**

1. **There is only one standard for mnemonic seed phrases (12/24 words).**

1. **Each derivation path (eg. `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0`, `m/44'/0'/0'/0/1`, ...) is guaranteed to derive a valid address.**

1. **Each private key corresponds to exactly one address.**

1. **Compressed WIF Bitcoin private keys are shorter than uncompressed keys.**

1. **Every integer from 1 to 2^256 is a valid private key for a Bitcoin address.**

1. **It is possible to convert an existing Bitcoin private key to a BIP39 mnemonic seed (12/24 words seed).**

1. **It is safe to handout the single private key of an address which was (non hardly) derived from an extended key (xpub/xprv) to a person who also knows the xpub (not the xprv) from which the address was derived from.**

1. **Each Bitcoin address has exactly one private key.**

1. **It is always possible to derive an address from an input (or output).**

1. **All Bitcoin addresses have the same length (number of characters).**

1. **All Bitcoin addresses are case-sensitive.**

1. **All coins spent within a single transaction (inputs) are controlled by the same entity (have the same owner).**

1. **Orders which are successfully placed on exchanges are guaranteed to be executed.**

1. **Ask price will always be equal or higher than bid price.**
